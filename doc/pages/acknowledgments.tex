First and foremost, I would like to thank my wife, Lejla, whose patience, love, and encouragement carried me through the many challenges of this journey. Without her unwavering support, neither this thesis nor my bachelor's degree would have been possible.

I am also sincerely grateful to my family, whose belief in me and continuous encouragement gave me the strength to pursue and complete my studies. Their support has been a constant source of motivation throughout this academic path.

My heartfelt thanks go to my supervisor, Tobias Eisenreich, for his guidance, valuable feedback, and constructive advice throughout the research process. I would also like to thank Michael Krinninger from FTAPI Software GmbH, who made this whole collaboration even possible.

Finally, I would like to thank all colleagues, friends, and mentors who contributed ideas, discussions, and encouragement along the way. Both this thesis and my bachelor's degree as a whole are as much a reflection of their support as they are of my own effort.
