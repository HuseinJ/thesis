Let's validate our design:

1. Walk through key business scenarios end-to-end
2. For each scenario:
   - Trace the flow through aggregates and contexts
   - Verify invariants are protected
   - Check transaction boundaries
   - Ensure eventual consistency is acceptable
   
3. Identify:
   - Performance bottlenecks (scaling etc.)
   - Consistency risks
   - Missing domain concepts
   - Over-engineering

Question every design decision: "Does this complexity serve the business need?"
