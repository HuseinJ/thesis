Now let's identify and map Bounded Contexts:

1. Group related terms from our glossary into potential bounded contexts
2. For each bounded context, define:
   - Core purpose and responsibility
   - Key aggregates within it
   - The ubiquitous language specific to this context
3. Identify relationships between contexts:
   - Upstream/Downstream relationships
   - Shared Kernel
   - Customer/Supplier
   - Conformist
   - Anti-corruption Layer needs
   - Published Language
4. Create a Context Map showing these relationships
5. Flag any terms that have different meanings across contexts

Question any contexts that seem too large or have unclear boundaries.
